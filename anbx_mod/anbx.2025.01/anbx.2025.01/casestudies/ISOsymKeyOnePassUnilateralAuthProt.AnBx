Protocol: ISOsymKeyOnePassUnilateralAuthProt AnB # Verified & Certified
# Note that this protocol has a trivial replay attack.  We thus
# specify only weak authentication as goal (not considering replay).
# The FP-module of OFMC currently does not handle injective
# authentication

Types: 
	Agent A,B;
    Number NA,Text1;
    Function [Agent,Agent ->* SymmetricKey] shk

Knowledge: 
	A: A,B,shk(A,B);
	B: B,A,shk(A,B);
	A,B share shk(A,B)
    
Actions:
	A->B: {|NA,B,Text1|}shk(A,B)

Goals:
	B weakly authenticates A on Text1
