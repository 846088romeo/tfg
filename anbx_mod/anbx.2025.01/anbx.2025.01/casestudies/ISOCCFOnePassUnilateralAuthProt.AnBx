Protocol: ISOCCFOnePassUnilateralAuthProt AnB # Verified 
# Note that this protocol has a trivial replay attack.  We thus
# specify only weak authentication as goal (not considering replay).
# The FP-module of OFMC currently does not handle injective
# authentication

Types:
    Agent A,B;
    Number NxA,NxB,Text1,Text2;
    Function [Agent, Agent ->* SymmetricKey] shk

Knowledge:
    A: A,B;
    B: B,A;
    B,A share shk(A,B)

Actions:
    A -> B: NxA,B,Text2,{|NxA,B,Text1|}shk(A,B),NxA,B,Text1

Goals:
    B weakly authenticates A on Text1
