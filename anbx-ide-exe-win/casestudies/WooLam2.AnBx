# http://www.lsv.fr/Software/spore/wooLamPi2.html
# Author(s): Woo, Lam  (1994)
# Summary: One way authentication protocol with public keys and trusted server, simplification of Woo and Lam Pi 1 and Woo and Lam Pi f. 

# keeps getting worse...

Types:
	Agent A,B,s;
	Number NB;
	Function [Agent,Agent ->* SymmetricKey] shk

Knowledge:
    A: A,B,s;
    B: B,A,s;
    s: A,B,s;
    A,s share shk(A,s);
    B,s share shk(B,s)


Actions:	
	A -> B: A
	B -> A: NB
	A -> B: {|A,NB|}shk(A,s)
	B -> s: {|A,{|A,NB|}shk(A,s)|}shk(B,s)
	s -> B: {|A,NB|}shk(B,s)

Goals:
	B authenticates A on NB
